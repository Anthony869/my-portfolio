      <strong>Background:</strong>  
      <p>I have always been interested in programming and computers in general. 
         Ever since I could remember I wnated to learn more about computer and how 
         they work. Technology has always been interesting and being able to control 
         them with code. As soon as I could take a class about computers in highschool 
         I did, I took Computer Science 3 the first year and continued with the path 
         after that. Before I could do that at school I went to camps over the summer to
         learn different languages each time.
        </p>
      <p>I also like to Golf and have for 9+ years. I have been playing since I was 
         like 6 or 7 because my Nonno introduced me to it. I've also played basketball
         and baseball but I didn't like them as much as I liked Golf. I tried out for 
         the golf team the first year I could when I was a freshman in highschool. 
         The next year I did the Junior Varsity with a bunch of my friends. I did the 
         same thing this year my golfing friends for a couple games.

      <strong>Photography:</strong>
      <p>I like to photogragh anything that I get the chance to take pictures of. 
         Some of my favoritie pictures where the ones from our trip to europe. I 
         also like to take picutres of bird that are nearby since we have a lot of
         trees and a lot of possiblities to see a bird. I also would like to take 
         landscape photos but I haven't been there with my camera a lot of the time 
         when I see a landscape that is worth photograghing.

      <strong>Hidden Talent(s):</strong>
      <p>One of my hidden talents is that I can solve a rubiks cube in under one 
         minute with my average being around 40 seconds. I have been practicing with 
         the rubiks cube since september in 2016 but it wasn't unitl february 2017 
         that I was able to solve in under 1:30 and without the algorithm sheet. Ever 
         since then my time have stayed steady at 30-40 seconds since I don't do it that 
         often anymore. I can still reliably get under 50 seconds but I'm far worse than
         I was before.
